# **3D Runner**
This is the second game created as a result of our training at Pantheon Academy. In this game, I preferred colors that I love, predominantly pink and purple. The objective of the game is for the player to collect flowers, avoid cacti, and not collide with obstacles.

## **Features:**
* Color Scheme: Predominantly pink and purple, reflecting personal preferences.
* Game Objective: Collect flowers while avoiding cacti and obstacles.
* Reward System: Upon collecting a certain number of flowers, the player triggers a celebratory animation that varies based on the number of flowers collected.


This game combines personal aesthetic choices with gameplay elements designed to challenge the player's avoidance skills while providing a visually appealing experience.
